PinPress

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bachya/PinPress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bachya/PinPress)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pinpress.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/pinpress)

PinPress is a simple CLI to create templates (HTML, Markdown, or otherwise) of Pinboard pins and tags.

# Why?

Every two weeks, I create a "link mash" for my website; this link mash consists of URLs that I find interesting and want to share with my readers. Previously, I would save those interesting URLs to an Evernote note and, every two weeks, manually create my link mash for use in Wordpress. <barf/>

When I began using [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in "Pinboard") to save interesting links, I knew I needed a better method. This tool is the result: **Pin**board + Word**press**.

# Prerequisites

In addition to Git (which, given you being on this site, I'll assume you have), Ruby (v. 1.9.3 or greater) is needed.

# Installation

```
gem install pinpress
```

# Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `pinpress help`:

```
$ pinpress help
NAME
    pinpress - A Pinboard application that allows for the creation of "pin templates" in almost any conceivable format.

SYNOPSIS
    pinpress [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION
    1.1.0

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help    - Show this message
    --version - Display the program version

COMMANDS
    help      - Shows a list of commands or help for one command
    init      - Install and initialize dependencies
    pins      - Get posts from Pinboard
    tags      - Get tags from Pinboard
    templates - Work with templates for pin output
```

Note that each command's options can be revealed by adding the `--help` switch after the command. For example:

```
$ pinpress pins --help
NAME
    pins - Get posts from Pinboard

SYNOPSIS
    pinpress [global options] pins [command options]

COMMAND OPTIONS
    -e arg - The end date to pull pins to (default: none)
    -n arg - The number of results to return (default: none)
    -s arg - The start date to pull pins from (default: none)
    -t arg - The tags to use (e.g., "ruby,pinboard") (default: none)
```

# Initialization

```
$ pinpress init
```

Initialization will prompt you to enter your Pinboard API token. Once, entered, this (and other pertinent data) will be stored in `~/.pinpress`.

# Getting Pins

```
$ pinpress pins
# => <ul><li><b><a title="Using Drafts for Remote CLI" href="https://gist.github.com/hiilppp/10993803" target="_blank">Using Drafts for Remote CLI</a>.</b> As a text file is added to a directory to which this AppleScript is associated as Folder Action, the content of the received file is executed as shell script and the generated output sent to an iOS device.</li></ul>
```

This simple command will return all pins from the user's account and output them based on the [Pin Template](https://github.com/bachya/PinPress#pin-templates "Pin Templates") provided.

Pinpress also provides some flags that allow a user to define specific pins to grab:

* `-s`: the start date to use (uses [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"), which allows dates like "last Tuesday")
* `-e`: the end date to use (also uses [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"))
* `-n`: the number of pins to return (e.g., 20)
* `-t`: a CSV list of tags to grab (e.g., "tag1,tag2")

## Getting Pins From a Date Forward

```
$ pinpress pins -s 2014-01-01
```

...returns all pins from January 1, 2014 to the current day.

## Getting Pins Until a Date

```
$ pinpress pins -e 2014-01-01
```

...returns all pins up to January 1, 2014.

## Getting Pins Between a Date Range

```
$ pinpress pins -s 2014-01-01 -e 2014-01-31
```

## Getting Tagged Pins

```
$ pinpress pins -t "ruby,cli"
```

...returns all pins tagged "ruby" *and* "cli".

# Getting Tags

Pinpress can also work with tags in a Pinboard account:

```
$ pinpress tags
# => cli (1),github (1),applescript (1),osx (1),link-mash (1)
```

This simple command will return all tags from the user's account and output them based on the [Tag Template](https://github.com/bachya/PinPress#tag-templates "Tag Templates") provided.

Pinpress also provides some flags that allow a user to define specific tags to grab:

* `-s`: the start date to use (uses [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"), which allows dates like "last Tuesday")
* `-e`: the end date to use (also uses [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic "Chronic"))

## Getting Tags From a Date Forward

```
$ pinpress tags -s 2014-01-01
```

...returns all tags used from January 1, 2014 to the current day. Note that for each tag returned, the data includes both the tag name and the number of times it was used.

## Getting Tags Until a Date

```
$ pinpress tags -e 2014-01-01
```

...returns all tags used up to January 1, 2014.

## Getting Tags Between a Date Range

```
$ pinpress tags -s 2014-01-01 -e 2014-01-31
```

# Templates

The first stop on the PinPress journey is templates. Templates are used to define how data should be output and are defined in `~/.pinpress` and come in two forms: **Pin Templates** and **Tag Templates**. 

## Pin Templates

Pin Templates define how a pin should be output.

### Schema

Pin Templates are placed under the `pin_templates` section of the `~/.pinpress` config file -- as an example:

```YAML
pin_templates:
- name: pinpress_default
  opener: "<ul>"
  closer: "</ul>"
  item: "<li><b><a title=\"<%= description %>\" href=\"<%= href %>\" target=\"_blank\"><%=
    description %></a>.</b> <%= extended %></li>"
  /Users/abach/.pinpress: "\n"
```

A Pin Template can have several different sub-keys:

* `name` (**required**): the name of the template
* `opener` (*optional*): the text that should exist above the pins
* `closer` (*optional*): the text that should exist above the pins
* `item` (**required**): the formatted text that should be output for every pin
* `/Users/abach/.pinpress` (**required**): the text that should exist between each pin ("item")

### Available Tokens

Additionally, a Pin Template can make use of several different tokens that are filled by a pin's values:

* `<%= href %>`: the URL of the pin
* `<%= description %>`: the description of the pin
* `<%= extended %>`: the pin's longer assocated description
* `<%= tag %>`: the CSV list of tags that apply to the pin
* `<%= time %>`: the time the pin was added to Pinboard
* `<%= replace %>`: the replacement status of the pin
* `<%= shared %>`: the privacy status of the pin
* `<%= toread %>`: the "to-read" status of the pin

### Usage

Pin Templates can be used in two ways: they can either be called dynamically:

```
$ pinpress pins template_name
```

...or a default template can be specified in `~/.pinpress`:

```
---
pinpress:
  config_location: "/Users/abach/.pinpress"
  default_pin_template: pinpress_default
  # ... other keys ...
pin_templates:
- name: pinpress_default
  opener: "<ul>\n"
  closer: "</ul>"
  item: "<li><b><a title=\"<%= description %>\" href=\"<%= href %>\" target=\"_blank\"><%=
    description %></a>.</b> <%= extended %></li>\N"
```

Using this example, here's what's output:

```
$ pinpress pins -s 'yesterday'
# => <ul>\n<li><b><a title="Using Drafts for Remote CLI" href="https://gist.github.com/hiilppp/10993803" target="_blank">Using Drafts for Remote CLI</a>.</b> As a text file is added to a directory to which this AppleScript is associated as Folder Action, the content of the received file is executed as shell script and the generated output sent to an iOS device.</li>\n</ul>
```

## Tag Templates

Tag Templates are exactly like Pin Templates, but are used for tags.

### Schema

They, too, are defined in `~/.pinpress`:

```YAML
tag_templates:
- name: pinpress_default
  item: "<%= tag %> (<%= count %>)"
  /Users/abach/.pinpress: ","
```

A Pin Template can have several different sub-keys:

* `name` (**required**): the name of the template
* `opener` (*optional*): the text that should exist above the pins
* `closer` (*optional*): the text that should exist above the pins
* `item` (**required**): the formatted text that should be output for every pin

### Available Tokens

Additionally, a Pin Template can make use of several different tokens that are filled by a pin's values:

* `<%= tag %>`: the name of the tag
* `<%= count %>`: the number of times the tag has been used in the range

### Usage

Pin Templates can be used in two ways: they can either be called dynamically:

```
$ pinpress tags template_name
```

...or a default template can be specified in `~/.pinpress`:

```
---
pinpress:
  config_location: "/Users/abach/.pinpress"
  default_tag_template: pinpress_default
  # ... other keys ...
pin_templates:
  # ... other keys ...
tag_templates:
- name: pinpress_default
  item: "<%= tag %> (<%= count %>),"
```

Using this example, here's what's output:

```
$ pinpress tags -s 'yesterday'
# => cli (1),github (1),applescript (1),osx (1),link-mash (1),
```
