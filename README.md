PinPress is a simple CLI to create templates (HTML, Markdown, or otherwise) of Pinboard pins and tags.

# Why?

Every two weeks, I create a "link mash" for my website; this link mash consists of URLs that I find interesting and want to share with my readers. Previously, I would save those interesting URLs to an Evernote note and, every two weeks, manually create my link mash. <barf/>

When I began using [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in "Pinboard") to save interesting links, I knew I needed a better method. This tool is the result

# Prerequisites

In addition to Git (which, given you being on this site, I'll assume you have), Ruby (v. 1.9.3 or greater) is needed.

# Installation

```
gem install sifttter-redux
```

# Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `srd help`:

```
$ pinpress help
