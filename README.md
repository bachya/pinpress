PinPress

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bachya/PinPress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bachya/PinPress)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pinpress.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/sifttter-redux)

PinPress is a simple CLI to create templates (HTML, Markdown, or otherwise) of Pinboard pins and tags.

# Why?

Every two weeks, I create a "link mash" for my website; this link mash consists of URLs that I find interesting and want to share with my readers. Previously, I would save those interesting URLs to an Evernote note and, every two weeks, manually create my link mash. <barf/>

When I began using [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in "Pinboard") to save interesting links, I knew I needed a better method. This tool is the result.

# Prerequisites

In addition to Git (which, given you being on this site, I'll assume you have), Ruby (v. 1.9.3 or greater) is needed.

# Installation

```
gem install sifttter-redux
```

# Usage

Syntax and usage can be accessed by running `srd help`:

```
$ pinpress help
NAME
    pinpress - A Pinboard application that allows for the creation of "pin templates" in almost any conceivable format.

SYNOPSIS
    pinpress [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION
    1.0.0

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help    - Show this message
    --version - Display the program version

COMMANDS
    help      - Shows a list of commands or help for one command
    init      - Install and initialize dependencies
    pins      - Get posts from Pinboard
    tags      - Get tags from Pinboard
    templates - Work with templates for pin output
```

Note that each command's options can be revealed by adding the `--help` switch after the command. For example:

```
$ pinpress pins --help
NAME
    pins - Get posts from Pinboard

SYNOPSIS
    pinpress [global options] pins [command options]

COMMAND OPTIONS
    -e arg - The end date to pull pins to (default: none)
    -n arg - The number of results to return (default: none)
    -s arg - The start date to pull pins from (default: none)
    -t arg - The tags to use (e.g., "ruby,pinboard") (default: none)
```

## Initialization

```
$ pinpress init
```

Initialization will prompt you to enter your Pinboard API token. Once, entered, this (and other pertinent data) will be stored in `~/.pinpress`.

## Templates

The first stop on the PinPress journey is templates. Templates are used to define how data should be output and are defined in `~/.pinpress` and come in two forms: **Pin Templates** and **Tag Templates**. 

### Pin Templates

Pin Templates are placed under the `pin_templates` section of the `~/.pinpress` config file -- as an example:

```YAML
pin_templates:
- name: pinpress_default
  opener: "<ul>"
  item: "<li><b><a title=\"<%= description %>\" href=\"<%= href %>\" target=\"_blank\"><%=
    description %></a>.</b> <%= extended %></li>"
  item_separator: "\n"
  closer: "</ul>"
```
